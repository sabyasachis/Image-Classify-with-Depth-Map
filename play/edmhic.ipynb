    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The small improvements that we can get using depth map as a channel means that our state of the art models should have been able to figure out depth map in their intermediate feature maps, but they are probably not doing a good job. Therefore, directly providing depth map as a channel results in improvements.\n",
